### Inspiration
Tarot brings to mind a lot of things. Some view it as a psychological inquiry into an individual's perceptions. Others view it as a spiritual exercise of divination into one's fate. This Application in the developer's opinion would best be utilized in the vein of psychological inquiry. Keep in mind your intention you would like the cards to reflect. The user should ask themselves something Open-Ended. Being too specific about a question in the developer's opinion is outside of the scope of this application.

### The Present By Problem
Also known as the Situation Crossed By... <br>
The upright card behind the horizontal card above it is the Present. This represents the root/essence of the question. <br>
The Horizontal card on top of the Present is called the Problem/Crossed By... This card represents issues surrounding the question. Think of something intersecting the situation rather than the situation itself.
### Conscious Thoughts
This is the Top of the Celtic Cross, above the Situation Cards. <br>
Conscious thoughts reflect what you are presently aware of regarding the situation cards.
### Unconscious Thoughts
This is mirrored to Conscious Thoughts, below the Situation Cards. <br>
Unconscious Thoughts reflect what exists in the back of your mind, out of sight, but influential just as much as Conscious Thoughts
### Recent Past
This card is to the left of the Situation Cards, Conscious Thoughts, and Unconscious Thoughts <br>
Recent Past represents the essence of what has transpired recently in relation to the situation. This is subjective as situations can very in importance. Usually represents a day or a week of time. But, maybe longer if the situation is one of greate significance.
### Near Future

Near Future represents the essence of probable coming events involving the situation cards. But, not the conclusion of the situation cards.
